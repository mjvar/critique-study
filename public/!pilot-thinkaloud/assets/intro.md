# Introduction

### Why are we conducting this study?
This research explores how people make sense of data about public issues. Your participation will help us understand how to improve visual data communication and education.

### Who can participate?
Anyone aged 18 or older who is fluent in English and has normal or corrected-to-normal vision. You must also have a working microphone on your device in order to clearly capture audio.

### Is participation voluntary?
Yes. You may stop at any time by closing your browser without penalty.

### What are the benefits and risks?
There are no major risks from participating. Some charts address political topics, which may cause mild discomfort. You may stop the survey at any time. While there are no direct personal benefits, your participation will advance research on how people think critically about data.

### Will I be paid? [PLACEHOLDER]
You will receive payment through Prolific at a rate consistent with the platform’s fair-pay policy ($12/hour, prorated to survey length).

### How will my data be used and stored?
Survey data will are stored on encrypted servers accessible only to the research team. The research ethics board of the University of Toronto may also have confidential access to data to help ensure participant protection procedures are followed. 

We collect emails for the purpose of sending payment, after which they will be deleted. Quotes might be included in publications, but only anonymously. You can ask for your response to be deleted for up to 2 weeks after the survey by emailing the research team.

### Who can I talk to if I have questions?

For questions about your rights as a research participant, you may contact the Human Research Ethics Unit at ethics.review@utoronto.ca.

### What happens if I say yes, but change my mind later?
You can decide not to participate in this research or you can start and then decide to leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. To do so, simply exit the experiment.  Any data already collected will not be saved.
