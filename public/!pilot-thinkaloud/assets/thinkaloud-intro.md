In the following sections, you will be presented with a few data visualizations. You will have 30 seconds to read and understand each visualization. After 30 seconds, click "Next" when you are ready to proceed. You will then be asked to do a speaking task and a writing task, though the order may vary.

For the writing task, please simply write how you would describe the data visualization in 3-5 words.

For the speaking task, you will be asked to critique the data visualization you just read. When you click "Start Recording", please speak into the microphone to say your thoughts. **Your critiques may focus on strengths or weaknesses of the visualization.** Once you are done speaking, click "Finish Recording" to end the recording.
