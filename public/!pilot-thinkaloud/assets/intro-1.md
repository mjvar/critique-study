# Welcome to the study!

### Why are we conducting this study?
In today's age, data plays a bigger role than ever in how we make sense of the world around us. We are researchers from the University of Toronto interested in how people understand and discuss data about public issues. By participating, you will help us understand how to improve visual data communication and education.

### Who can participate?
Anyone aged 18 or older who lives in the United States, is fluent in English, and has normal or corrected-to-normal vision. You must also have a working microphone on your device in order to clearly capture audio—we will help you test the microphone later to ensure that you can respond.

### What does the study entail?
This study has 3 parts:
- **Part 1:** You’ll fill out some basic information about yourself and what media you consume. 
- **Part 2:** You’ll answer multiple-choice questions about the data visualizations we show you.
- **Part 3:** You’ll take a look at a few more data visualizations and share your thoughts out loud using the microphone on your device.

In total, it should take around 20 minutes. There will be a few breaks throughout the study so you can refresh your mind or take a sip of water. 

Participation in this study is **anonymous**: we won't ask you for your name or other directly identifying information.

### Will I be paid?
You'll receive $5 through Prolific for your participation in this study.

### What are the benefits and risks?
There are no major risks from participating. Some charts address political topics, which may cause mild discomfort. You may exit the survey at any time, although in order to receive payment you have to complete the full survey. While there are no direct personal benefits aside from payment, your participation will advance research on public data communication.

### How will my data be used and stored?
Your responses will be stored on encrypted servers accessible only to the research team. The research ethics board of the University of Toronto may also have confidential access to data to help ensure participant protection procedures are followed. 

Quotes from your responses might be included in publications, but only anonymously. You can ask for your response to be deleted for up to 2 weeks after the survey by emailing the research team.

### Who can I talk to if I have questions?
If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, please contact the Principal Investigator, Matthew Varona, at varona@cs.toronto.edu. For questions about your rights as a research participant, you may contact the Human Research Ethics Unit at ethics.review@utoronto.ca.
