# Part 2

For this part of the study, we will show you a series of data visualizations along with some questions about them. Please answer the questions to the best of your ability.

You will have up to 1 minute to answer each question, but you are encouraged to answer earlier if you can. At 30 seconds left you will be shown a timer, and if time runs out you will have to skip the question.
