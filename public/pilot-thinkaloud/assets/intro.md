# Introduction

### Why are we conducting this study?
This research explores how people make sense of data about public issues. Your participation will help us understand how to improve visual data communication and education.

### Who can participate?
Anyone aged 18 or older who is fluent in English and has normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

### Is participation voluntary?
Yes. You may stop at any time by closing your browser without penalty.

### What are the benefits and risks?
There are no major risks from participating. Some charts address political topics, which may cause mild discomfort. You may stop the survey at any time. While there are no direct personal benefits, your participation will advance research on how people think critically about data.

### Will I be paid? [PLACEHOLDER]
You will receive payment through Prolific at a rate consistent with the platform’s fair-pay policy ($12/hour, prorated to survey length).

### How will my data be used and stored?
Survey data will are stored on encrypted servers accessible only to the research team. The research ethics board of the University of Toronto may also have confidential access to data to help ensure participant protection procedures are followed. 

We collect emails for the purpose of sending payment, but won’t use them to contact you otherwise unless you opt-in to a follow-up interview. Quotes might be included in publications, but any identifying details will be removed. You can ask for your response to be deleted for up to 2 weeks after the survey by emailing the research team.
